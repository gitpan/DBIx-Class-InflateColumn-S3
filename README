[1mNAME[0m
       DBIx::Class::InflateColumn::S3 - pulls files off the FS and loads them
       into Amazon's Simple Storage Service using NET::AMAZON::S3

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       Put this in your  DBIx::Class table class:

        __PACKAGE__->add_columns(
           # your other column definitions here
           'object',
           {
               data_type   => 's3',
               size        => 255,
               bucket_name => $target_bucket_name
           },
           # and maybe some more here
        );

       To create a row with said S3 column:

        $schema->resultset('YourClass')->create({
           object      => {
               #the name of the key you would like
               key     => $key_name,
               #the path to your file in the local FS
               fs_path => $path,

               # OPTIONAL, override the bucket defined in the table class
               bucket  => $bucket,
               # OPTIONAL, one of the recognize ACL types from the S3 docs
               acl     => $ACL # defaults to private
               # the accessID provided by amazon web services
               access_id  => $access_id,
               # the secret_key provided by amazon web services
               secret_key => $secret_key
           },
        });

       Retrieving a row with the an S3 column currently only retrieves the key
       that was stored in S3 in the format of $bucket_name/$key.

       More fun later!

       Remove dies and raise exceptions

       Add delete methods,

       Rreturn a simple object that provides convience accessors to basic
